# SigBovik Conference Management System

## Setup

### Stack
We are using [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/)
to build the project and manage its dependencies. You'll need stack to work on this
project.

### Yesod
We are using a web framework for Haskell called [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/).
You can follow the instructions [here](http://www.yesodweb.com/page/quickstart) to
get started with Yesod.

## Running Locally
Yesod makes it really easy to run the project locally. All you'll need to do is run
`stack exec yesod devel`, and then visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
